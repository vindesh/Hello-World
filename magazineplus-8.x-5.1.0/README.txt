Magazine+ 8.x-5.1.0 README
======================

Thank you for downloading Magazine+ - Standalone distribution.
This distribution includes a built-in Drupal installation profile,
a state-of-the-art theme and full-layered .psd source file(s),
so it's ready to run (almost) out the box.

Overview
--------

Specifically, your theme pack consists of the following four
directories:

    * [documentation]
      Includes the full documentation in PDF and HTML formats
    * [simple_theme_installation]
      Includes the premium theme, modules and configuration to use during
      the simple theme installation procedure
    * [full_installation]
      Includes a full drupal installation and the corresponding .sql database
      to use during the full featured installation procedure.
    * [license]
      Includes the License information and references to
      third-party licenses.
    * [psd]
      Includes the full-layered psd file(s) this theme is
      based on.

You can use the files to build a static web site or to create
your own theme for any platform, as long as this is permitted by
the License. You can dig into the source psd files and modify them
the way you want and reuse, as long as this is permitted by the
License. Lastly, you can use our installation profile to setup
your drupal.

in the [documentation] folder or through the documentation URL above
-------------------------------------------------------

   1. Unzip the Magazine+ Drupal theme package.
   2. Locate the [site]/[d8] directory and upload its content to your
      server. This directory includes Drupal core and all of the
      required modules that are used in the theme. If you wish to
      install the theme in your root directory (often called the
      "/public_html/" directory), simply place all the extracted
      files and folders into this directory. Place all files in a
      sub-directory, if you want the theme installed in a sub-directory
      of your website.
   3. (important) Create the MySQL database. Make a note of the complete
      database name. You will need your database username and password
      during the first couple of steps of your theme installation.
   4. Import the "[site]/[d8]/[_data]/db_instance.sql" file in your newly
      created MySQL database.
   5. Start the Drupal installation wizard by pointing your browser to the
      recently created folder, in your Apache server path.
   6. Continue the installation by selecting the "Standard" installation profile.
   7. Enter your recently created database information. This includes the database name
      and credentials (username/password) you have chosen when creating it.
   8. The installation wizard will recognise that you are using an already populated
      database and will inform you accordingly. At the same time, the wizard should
      create all the necessary files your Drupal site needs in order to work properly on
      your server.
   9. You are done. Click on the "visit existing site" link, to visit your new site.

Once you are done with the above, please login to this site by using the following
credentials:
   u: admin​
   p: password​
